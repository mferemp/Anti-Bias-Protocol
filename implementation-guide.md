# Implementation Guide

1. Initialize: Paste the full Anti‑Bias Protocol (AB Check) command block at the beginning of each new thread.
2. Inquiry: Ask your fact‑finding questions underneath the command block.
3. Reinforcement: Every 3–4 prompts, type `AB Check` to recalibrate to the protocol.
4. Audit: At the end of a section or the whole inquiry, type `AB Sweep` so the model self‑audits, discloses deviations, and offers a corrected report.
